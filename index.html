			<p>Everything started when Fran√ßois du Grandlaunay farmed with his grand mother in the backyard. This got the creator of BioEat thinking that people should be able to eat better. By better, he meant food without chemicals and for a better price. In 2023, the startup BioEat is created and now, you can buy the best vedgetables around you online ! </p>
